The field of machine learning has witnessed a surge in research on generative models, as these models possess the ability to generate novel data similar to the training data. We explore various types of generative models, with a thorough analysis of their respective limitations and potential applications. Additionally, we also investigate several influence methods / instance-based interpretation and explore their efficacy in relevant applications.
