I am a 4th-year Mathematics of Computation undergraduate student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I am passionate about using mathematics and machine learning to tackle new challenges and unlock the potentials of emerging technologies. My research interests are in **Explainable AI**, **Generative Models**, **Graph Neural Network**, and **AI4Science**. Previously, I participated in UCLA's computational and applied math (CAM) REU, where we conduct research in applying statistis to investigate the effectiveness of Los Angeles Gang Prevention program under the guidence of Prof. [Andrea Bertozzi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/) and Dr. Jona Lelmi. Currently, I am conducting research at [UCLA Computational Machine Learning Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/chohsieh-research/home) and at [UCLA Data Mining Lab](https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/) where I am foutunate to be advised by Prof. [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/) and Prof. [Yizhou Sun](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/). 

Feel free to connect with me and explore new opportunities, future collaborations, and exciting ventures together!
