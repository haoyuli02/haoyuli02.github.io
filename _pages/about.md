I am a 4th-year Mathematics of Computation undergraduate student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I am passionate about using mathematics to tackle new challenges and unlock the potentials of emerging technologies. My research interests are in **Explainable AI**, **Generative Models**, **Graph Neural Network**, and **AI4Science**. Currently, I am working on projects to develop practical interpretation methods for deep learning models, seeking to shed light on the inner workings of these complex "black-box" methods and making AI more transparent. I am open to exploring more ML areas and opportunities as well!

Feel free to connect with me and explore new opportunities, future collaborations, and exciting ventures together!
