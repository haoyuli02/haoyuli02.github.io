I am a 3rd-year Applied Mathematics undergraduate student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I am passionate about using mathematics to tackle new challenges and unlock the potentials of emerging technologies. My research focus is machine learning, with a particular interest on the topic of explainability in deep learning, as it seeks to shed light on the inner workings of complex models and make AI more transparent and interpretable. 

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in [Global Entrepreneurship Society (GES) at UCLA](https://gesatucla.org/), a student organization that ignites my curiosity for new innovations and encourages entrepreneurial thinking. I also had the opportunity to intern at [Startup UCLA](https://startupucla.com/), where the dynamic startup ecosystem gave me hands-on experience of turning groundbreaking ideas into reality.

Feel free to connect with me and explore new opportunities, future collaborations, and exciting ventures together!
