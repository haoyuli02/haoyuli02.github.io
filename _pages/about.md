I am a 3rd-year Applied Mathematics undergraduate student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I am passionate about using mathematics to tackle new challenges and unlock the potentials of emerging technologies. My research interests are in deep learning and generative models. Currently, I am working on projects to develop practical interpretation methods for deep learning models, seeking to shed light on the inner workings of these complex "black-box" methods and making AI more transparent. I am open to exploring more ML areas and opportunities as well!

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in various student organizations at UCLA. I am currently the Co-President at [Global Entrepreneurship Society (GES) at UCLA](https://gesatucla.org/), a student organization that ignites my curiosity for new innovations and encourages entrepreneurial thinking. I also had the opportunity to intern at [Startup UCLA](https://startupucla.com/), where the dynamic startup ecosystem gave me hands-on experience of turning groundbreaking ideas into reality.

Feel free to connect with me and explore new opportunities, future collaborations, and exciting ventures together!
