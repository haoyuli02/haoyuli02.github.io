The field of machine learning has witnessed a surge in research on generative models, as these models possess the ability to generate novel data similar to the training data. [In this page](https://descriptive-ravioli-e02.notion.site/Generative-Models-5daf5dc59d4c48d29337c6edfaad0927), our primary objective is to explore various types of generative models, with a thorough analysis of their respective limitations and potential applications. Additionally, we will investigate several influence methods and explore their efficacy in addressing the issue of memorization in generative models. 

## Generative Models
1. Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
3. Normalizing Flows
4. Diffusion Models

## Influence Methods
1. TracIn
2. Influence Functions
3. Representer Points
